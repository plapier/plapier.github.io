      <p>The Chooser and Saver are critical pieces of architecture in Dropbox's strategy to become a thriving ecosystem. It's the connective tissue that developers use to grant their customers the functionality to securely choose and save files stored in Dropbox.</p>

      <h2 class="poppins">Modern and streamlined</h2>
      <p>Both the Chooser and the Saver were in dire need of an update. By bringing the products up to speed with our latest design system and extending support for new functionality&mdash;like multiple file selection, grid view, and account switching&mdash;developer satisfaction and adoption greatly improved.</p>

      <p>Well-designed systems are able to scale across platforms, viewports, and devices with minimal changes. We later launched Dropbox for Microsoft Outlook using the core experience of Chooser and Saver.</p>
