      <p>Iâ€™m a designer, a craftsman, and a creative thinker. Currently, I lead design at <a href="https://pilot.com" target="_blank" class="pilot">Pilot.com.</a></p>

          As a product designer at <a href="https://dropbox.com" target="_blank" class="dropbox">Dropbox</a>, I built innovative experiences that pushed the bounds of desktop collaboration. I received a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180052587A1/en?oq=15%2f339729" target="_blank" class="dropbox">patent</a> for technology I invented and won a coveted Hack Week award. I designed notable software integrations for key partnerships with Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook.

        At <a href="https://thoughtbot.com" target="_blank" class="thoughtbot">thoughtbot</a>, I created a popular open-source CSS framework called <a href="https://www.bourbon.io" target="_blank" class="thoughtbot">Bourbon</a>. It's surpassed <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/bourbon" target="_blank" class="thoughtbot">22 million</a> downloads and was nominated for open-source project of the year by .net magazine in 2014.
